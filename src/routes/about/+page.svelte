		<span class="text-ctp-mauve">### Introduction</span>
		Hi, my name is Isaac Arcia and I'm an electronic engineering (about to graduate) student and self taught developer.
		During the pandemic in 2020, in my first year of college, I attended the in-person course <a href="https://code-fu.net.ni/" class="underline">CS50x.ni</a>.
		Having completed the course successfully (see my <a href="documents/CS50x through CS50x.ni.pdf" class="underline">certificate</a>) I ended up developing a passion for anything coding related and thus
		have gathered tons of experience, but mostly from hobby-ish projects.
		My actual work experience comes from as little as (almost) two years ago when I worked along a cousin of mine for a local 
		financial institution, developing a new system for managing client loans among other things.
		Since then, I've been working on and off as a freelancer for other local companies. Now, as I'm about to graduate, I'm looking for
		a more stable, remote job as a Full-stack developer.
		If you like what you see here and have an open position at your company, I'd love to hear from you.
		<br>
		<span class="text-ctp-pink">### Skills</span>
		I know how to use the following tools:
		- Web Dev: Svelte, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, AWS, Nginx
		- Backend: Python (Flask, Strawberry GraphQL, Psycopg), PostgreSQL
		- Systems & Tools: Linux, Bash, SSH, Git, Neovim
		But beyond that, by far my greatest skill is my adaptability. I'm a fast, self-taught learner. If I need to learn something new
		for a job, I'd probably get it down in a day and start working right away. That's in fact how I've learned everything I know.
